# Intro to Mixing

In this sheet we start the process of mixing.
Before starting on this please make sure you have downloaded Reaper and the project files as explained in the setup guide

**add links to setup guide**

We are going to start by mixing a song that has already been loaded into Reaper.

If you haven’t already, then open Reaper and select “File - Open Project”.

Navigate to LWaudio/Projects/CrownHim and select the CrownHim project file.

Your window should now look like this:

You can press “Spacebar” to play and stop the recording. Try this now and check that you can hear the music.

The screen is divided into the track view and timeline in the top half and the mixer in the bottom half. In both halves you can see all the tracks listed and access some basic controls but the track view allows you to see the waveform of the recorded audio in the timeline and the mixer view allows you to see the effects you have applied and the volume meter.

Each track has a mute button and a solo button as shown below. These allow you to choose not to hear certain tracks or only to hear certain tracks.
For example you could listen to the instruments without the singers by muting the vocal tracks or listen to the guitar and bass by themselves by soloing them.
