# Virtual instruments

While it is not a particular strength of Reaper, you can work with virtual instruments to supplement the recorded audio. Reaper comes with one synth included although other instruments can be downloaded in the VSTi format.
To add a virtual instrument track, go to “Track - Insert virtual instrument on new track”. This will bring up a list of the available instruments to add to the project. In this case select ReaSynth.
This will automatically open the synth window in the same way as any other effect plugin. There are a range of parameters you can use to change the sound of the synth.
You will then need a way to play notes through this new instrument. Ideally you would connect a musical keyboard to the computer but we can make do with a virtual keyboard by pressing “Alt - B”. You can then click on keys or use the letters shown on the keyboard to play the synth.
In order to record a part you will need to use the record button or press “Ctrl - R”. You can stop the recording just the same way as you would stop playback.
You can edit your recording in the midi editor by double clicking the recording in the timeline.

Alternatively you could use “Insert - New MIDI item” to create an empty midi item and program the part entirely through the midi editor without using a virtual keyboard.
