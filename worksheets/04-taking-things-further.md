# Taking things further

In the next session, we shall start to introduce more ideas and techniques, but if you would like to try what we have covered in this session with other recordings then this website has collections of tracks to download in a whole variety of genres.

They are all professionally recorded and have a variety of track counts from just three or four to over 40. You can select based on genre and and listen to a preview clip of each song before downloading the tracks. (Scroll down to see the list)
