# Taking things further

At this point, you may wish to go back and apply some of the more advanced techniques such as compression or automation to the first project that you started with. (Don't forget to save your work)

When you are happy with your mixes, it would be great if you could export them and share them in the Slack channel.
This is also a good way to ask for feedback if you want to ask about how you can improve your mixes further.

Joel has very kindly provided tracks to two more songs and these each have different bands and more tracks. You will need to think about the roles of each track, when they play and how they should be grouped. Using the techniques you have learned so far, you should be able to have a good go at mixing them yourself but please do ask in Slack if you want to discuss them and get some advice.

If you would like to try what we have covered in these session with other recordings then the website linked below has collections of tracks to download in a whole variety of genres.

They are all professionally recorded and have a variety of track counts from just three or four to over 40. You can select based on genre and and listen to a preview clip of each song before downloading the tracks. (Scroll down to see the list)
