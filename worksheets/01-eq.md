# Eq

Now that the tracks are well balanced, we can start to apply effects to enhance them further. Eq is a very powerful tool that is used to adjust the sound of a track. For example we could use it to boost the low or high frequencies or perhaps cut a band of frequencies in the midrange.
This becomes more clear when you try it, so I recommend having a play with the Eq plugin to listen to what happens.

To add an effect to a channel, clip on the button labelled “FX” at the top of the track in the mixer view. This should bring up the window shown in the next image, which allows you to pick an effect to add to the track.
The list of effects in Reaper is very long so I recommend that you select “All plugins” - “VST” on the left hand side to narrow the choice down slightly and make it easier to find the ones we will be using.

In this case, select ReaEQ. Once you click add, the effects selection will be replaced by the Eq window. If you close this window and want to bring it up again then you can click on the box that will now say “ReaEQ” in the mixer view on the track you have just added the effect to.

The top half of the Eq window shows a graph and the bottom half has a number of controls. You can control the plugin using either, but I find it easier to drag the points around on the graph most of the time.

If you solo the track you have applied the effect to, set the music playing and start to drag the points around you should be able to hear the impact it has.

Have a play with the Eq on a selection of tracks and get used to the way it works - you can use the “Add band” button to get more points on the graph to work with.
You can click on the green “FX” button in the mixer view to turn the effect off and on to hear the sound with an without the Eq.

See if you can use it to help particular tracks either blend in more or stand out more from the rest of the band.
